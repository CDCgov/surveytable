\item{...}{names of variables (in quotes)}

\item{raw}{also output raw counts? (Useful for performing further calculations
, such as calculating rates.)}

\item{max.levels}{a categorical variable can have at most this many levels. Used to avoid printing huge tables.}

a list of \code{huxtable} tables.

\description{
Operates on categorical and logical variables, and presents the estimated
counts, their standard errors (SEs) and confidence intervals (CIs),
percentages, and their SEs and CIs. Checks the presentation guidelines for
counts and percentages and flags estimates if, according to the guidelines,
they should be suppressed, footnoted, or reviewed by an analyst. CIs are
calculated at the 95\% confidence level. CIs for the percentage estimates are
calculated using the Korn and Graubard method.
